# Text-to-daily

## Description
Text-to-daily is a command-line program that converts plain text into justified text in a daily-like format.

## Requirements
1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system.

2. Ensure that you have a file named "input.txt" in the same folder as the program, containing the text to be processed.

## Usage
1. Compile the program by running the make command.

2. Execution:
	- Single-process Version: Use the command ./Mono.
	- Multi-process Version: Use the command ./Multi.
	- Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the required parameters. It is recommended to choose a column width that is not smaller than the length of the longest word in the input text.

3. The program will process the text and generate an output file named "output.txt" containing the justified text in a newspaper-like format.
